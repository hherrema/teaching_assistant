    "## Assignment Overview:\n",
    "A few items to note in recognition memory analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hits, False Alarms, Misses, and Correct Rejections\n",
    "In the continuous recognition paradigm, each trial you are asked to determine if an item is old or new.  We can define each response as one of the following:\n",
    "* Hit = say \"old\", actual old\n",
    "* False Alarm = say \"old\", actual new\n",
    "* Miss = say \"new\", actual old\n",
    "* Correct Rejection = say \"new\", actual new\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ROC curve\n",
    "In the ROC curve, we want to plot Hit Rate (y-axis) and False Alarm Rate (x-axis) as a function of confidence threshold.  That means that each (x,y) point on the curve will correspond to the (HR, FAR) for a different chosen confidence threshold.  If we have 8 confidence thresholds, we should have 8 points on the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Between-Subjects Average\n",
    "In psychology, we often choose to treat subjects (i.e. each individual that participates in the experiment) as independent when we do our statistics.  So, when we calculate means of our data, we want a between-subjects average.  In other words, we do the analysis for each subject to get an average for each subject, and then calculate the average of those averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we had 3 subjects with scores of: $\\frac{4}{10}$, $\\frac{10}{20}$, and $\\frac{36}{40}$.  We want to report a bewteen-subjects average of $\\frac{0.4 + 0.5 + 0.9}{3} = 0.6$ instead of $\\frac{4 + 10 + 36}{10 + 20 + 40} = 0.714$.  This way, our results aren't biased towards subjects with more data."
